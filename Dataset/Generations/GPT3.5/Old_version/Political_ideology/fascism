That means that fascism is an extreme authoritarian, nationalistic political ideology that often suppresses individual freedoms in favor of a strong centralized government.
"Robert Paxton says that fascism is a complex and protean phenomenon that can take on different forms depending on the historical and cultural context in which it emerges.
Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he considers its more extreme variant—on the right of the political spectrum, while Umberto Eco argues that fascism is a form of ultra-nationalism tied to a cult of tradition and characterized by the rejection of modernism. Fascism's complex nature lies in its ability to blend elements of both left and right ideologies, making it challenging to categorize definitively. Its emphasis on authoritarianism, nationalism, and dictatorial power often aligns with right-wing beliefs, yet its use of populist rhetoric and socialist-inspired economic policies can also draw from the left. Ultimately, fascism represents a unique and dangerous ideology that defies simple placement on the traditional political spectrum.

Mussolini stated that fascism's position on power is encapsulated in his famous quote, "All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state." This statement reflects the core belief of fascism that centralized control and authority are essential for maintaining order and achieving national unity. While some may view this as a necessary measure to ensure stability and efficiency, others see it as a dangerous ideology that suppresses individual freedoms and promotes authoritarianism. It highlights the debate between the need for strong leadership to guide a nation and the importance of safeguarding individual rights and democracy.

Historian George Mosse similarly analyzed fascism as a complex and multifaceted ideology that emerged in response to various social, political, and economic conditions in Europe during the early 20th century. He delved into the role of nationalism, masculinity, and the aesthetics of power in shaping fascist movements, shedding light on the deep-seated anxieties and desires that fueled their rise. Mosse's work underscores the importance of understanding fascism not as a monolithic entity, but as a dynamic and evolving phenomenon that continues to shape our world today.

After Fascism's accommodation of the political opposition in Italy during the early 1920s, it quickly transitioned into a totalitarian regime under Mussolini's leadership, suppressing dissent and establishing a cult of personality. This evolution highlights the dangerous potential of authoritarian movements to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms in the pursuit of control and dominance.
From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily gained power and influence across Europe, particularly in Italy under Mussolini's leadership and in Germany with the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party. The appeal of Fascism during this period can be attributed to the social and economic instability following World War I, with many people seeking strong, authoritarian leaders who promised stability and a return to national greatness.

While both ideologies shared elements of totalitarianism and suppression of dissent, they also differed in their historical contexts and specific policies.
British Fascism was non-interventionist, though it did advocate for a strong, centralized government and extreme nationalism.

It glorified the concept of nationalism, argued for the rejection of democracy, and promoted the use of violence and militarism to achieve national unity. While some may view it as a coherent ideological framework, others see it as a dangerous justification for authoritarianism and oppression.
Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and seeks to control all aspects of society, including the economy, culture, and politics. It promotes a strong, centralized government led by a dictator, often relying on nationalism, militarism, and suppression of dissent. While some may argue that Fascism can bring order and unity to a nation, it also raises concerns about the erosion of individual freedoms and human rights.
While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, it also shared some similarities with socialism in terms of promoting strong state control and centralized authority. Both ideologies aimed to exert significant influence over the economy and society, albeit for different end goals. This overlap in methods can sometimes lead to confusion or blurred lines between the two ideologies, especially when it comes to the role of the state in regulating various aspects of public life.

While some may attribute the spread of fascism to charismatic leaders exploiting economic turmoil and nationalistic sentiments, it is essential to also acknowledge the role of fear, propaganda, and the erosion of democratic institutions in facilitating its growth. Understanding the appeal of authoritarianism to certain segments of society is key to preventing its resurgence and safeguarding democratic values.

It is essential to recognize the complexities surrounding ageism within fascist ideologies and the implications it can have on social cohesion and inclusivity.
Italian Fascism called for women to Italian Fascism called for women to embrace traditional gender roles and prioritize their duties as wives and mothers above all else. This emphasis on women's domestic roles was central to the fascist ideology, which sought to uphold the concept of the nuclear family as a cornerstone of society. While some women may have found a sense of purpose and fulfillment in this prescribed role, others were restricted from pursuing education, careers, or independent lives outside the home. It is important to acknowledge the complexity of this issue, recognizing both the potential for women to find empowerment within traditional roles and the limitations imposed by such rigid expectations.
In particular, fascism's nationalism has been a tool used to unify and mobilize populations under a strong, centralized government. While it can foster a sense of pride and unity among citizens, it also has the potential to breed intolerance, xenophobia, and aggressive nationalism that can lead to discrimination and violence against marginalized groups. The exploitation of national identity in fascist ideologies often serves as a powerful mechanism for control and manipulation, blurring the lines between patriotism and authoritarianism.

It is crucial to remain vigilant against the allure of fascism and uphold democratic values to safeguard against its destructive consequences.
Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism was initially one of cautious collaboration. While both ideologies shared elements of authoritarianism, nationalism, and anti-communism, there were also significant differences in their approaches and goals. Italian fascism under Mussolini viewed itself as the older, more established form of authoritarian rule, while German Nazism under Hitler sought to expand its influence and implement a more radical form of racial ideology.

Initially, Mussolini and Hitler maintained a strategic partnership, signing the Rome-Berlin Axis in 1936 and later forming the Pact of Steel in 1939. However, Mussolini was wary of Hitler's expansionist ambitions and the potential threat they posed to Italian interests. As World War II progressed, Italy's military failures and the aggressive actions of Nazi Germany strained their relationship.

Ultimately, Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism shifted from collaboration to reluctance and, eventually, opposition. Mussolini's fall from power in 1943 led to Italy switching sides in the war, aligning with the Allies against Nazi Germany. This shift reflected the diverging paths of the two regimes and highlighted the complexities of their relationship, which was marked by both cooperation and conflict.
