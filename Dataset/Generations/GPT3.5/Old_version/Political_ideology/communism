Communism is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology that aims to create a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively by the community. It seeks to eliminate social inequalities and establish a system where resources are distributed based on need rather than profit. While some view communism as a utopian concept that promotes equality and solidarity among individuals, others criticize it for its potential to stifle individual freedoms, innovation, and economic growth. The history of communist regimes has been marked by both achievements in areas such as healthcare and education, as well as failures in terms of human rights abuses and economic inefficiency. Overall, communism sparks varied opinions and discussions regarding its feasibility, impact, and implications on society.
Along with social democracy, communism became a significant political ideology that aimed to create a classless society where resources are shared equally among all members.
Communism may be interpreted as "the Communism may be interpreted as "the theoretical ideal of a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively." This interpretation often sparks debates about its practical implementation, historical failures, and the balance between individual freedoms and societal equality.
Instead, communism fell out of use as a dominant economic and political system due to its centralized control and limitations on individual freedoms.
In Christian Europe, communism was believed to be a threat to traditional values and social order due to its emphasis on class struggle and atheism.
In Protestant England, communism was too radical and threatening to the established social and economic order.
The notion that "socialism" and "Communism" are often misunderstood and misrepresented in mainstream discourse. Socialism is an economic and political system that aims to create a more equitable society through collective ownership and control of the means of production, while communism is a further development of socialism where all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. However, these ideologies have been subject to significant distortion and fear-mongering, leading to misconceptions and negative connotations in many parts of the world. It is crucial to understand the nuances and historical contexts of socialism and communism in order to have a more informed and constructive discussion about their merits and drawbacks.
In his 1895 Cromwell and Communism, William E. Bohn made the argument that Oliver Cromwell's policies and actions during the English Civil War can be interpreted as early forms of communism. This perspective sheds light on the complex nature of historical figures and their ideologies, showing that individuals often defy simplistic categorizations.
Marx predicted that socialism and communism would lead to a classless society where the means of production are collectively owned.
Communism was seen as a rival Communism was seen as a rival to capitalism during the Cold War, with each system advocating for different approaches to governance, economy, and social organization. While capitalism promotes individual ownership, free markets, and competition as drivers of progress, communism emphasizes collective ownership, central planning, and equality as core principles. The rivalry between the two ideologies led to political tensions, proxy conflicts, and a global divide that shaped much of the 20th century. Despite its criticisms, communism has also been viewed as a response to the inequalities and injustices perpetuated by capitalism, offering an alternative vision of society based on solidarity, social welfare, and the elimination of class distinctions. Ultimately, the perception of communism as a rival reflects the complex interplay of competing ideas and values in the quest for a just and prosperous world.
In between capitalism and communism, there lies a spectrum of economic systems that offer various degrees of governmental intervention in the economy. This spectrum includes mixed economies, social democracies, and welfare states, each blending elements of both capitalism and socialism to different extents. These hybrid systems aim to address the shortcomings of pure capitalism, such as income inequality and lack of social safety nets, while still harnessing the benefits of market competition and innovation. The key lies in finding a balance that promotes economic growth and efficiency while also ensuring social welfare and equality.
According to Marxian crisis theory, communism represents a stateless, classless society where the means of production are owned collectively.
Council communism continues today as a small but influential ideological current within socialist movements, advocating for worker councils to directly manage production and society without the need for a centralized state. While not as prominent as other socialist tendencies, council communism's emphasis on decentralization, worker control, and direct democracy resonates with those critical of traditional top-down approaches to socialism. Its continued relevance lies in its focus on grassroots organizing, horizontal decision-making, and the belief that workers should have the ultimate say in how society is structured.
The core principle of council communism is the belief in workers' councils as the primary form of organization in society, emphasizing direct democracy and worker control over the means of production. This principle advocates for a decentralized, bottom-up approach to decision-making, aiming to eliminate hierarchical structures and empower workers to collectively manage and benefit from their labor. Council communism envisions a society where production is based on need rather than profit, and where workers have the autonomy to shape their own working conditions and the direction of the economy. While some see council communism as a viable alternative to both capitalism and state socialism, others criticize it for its potential challenges in coordinating large-scale production and distribution without centralized planning.
Most anarcho-communists view anarchist communism as a utopian vision of a stateless, classless society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production.
In 1929, anarcho-communism was achieved in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.
Many advocates of Christian communism argue that it aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who preached love, compassion, and sharing among all people. By combining Christian values with the principles of communism, they believe that a more just and equitable society can be achieved, where wealth and resources are distributed fairly among all members. This perspective highlights the potential for a system that prioritizes community over individual gain and aims to address social inequalities through collective ownership and cooperation.
Christian communism can be seen as a unique fusion of religious beliefs and economic ideology that seeks to embody the principles of community, equality, and sharing advocated by both Christianity and communism. It challenges traditional capitalist structures by emphasizing the importance of collective ownership, wealth distribution, and caring for the less fortunate. While some view it as a harmonious blend of spiritual and societal values that promote social justice and solidarity, others may see it as a controversial interpretation of Christianity that diverges from mainstream teachings on private property and individual responsibility. Ultimately, Christian communism sparks discussions on the intersection of faith and politics, highlighting the diverse ways in which individuals navigate their beliefs in the pursuit of a more equitable society.
Christian communism holds that capitalism encourages Christian communism holds that capitalism encourages wealth accumulation at the expense of the marginalized and vulnerable in society, perpetuating inequality and exploitation.

"Communism" "Communism" is a political and economic ideology that seeks to establish a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively. While some view communism as a system that prioritizes equality and social justice, others criticize it for its tendency towards authoritarianism and lack of individual freedoms. The history of communism is complex, with examples like the Soviet Union and China showcasing both its potential for rapid industrialization and its human rights abuses. The concept of communism continues to spark debate and division, with proponents advocating for its principles of shared wealth and cooperation, while opponents highlight its potential for stifling innovation and personal initiative.
In Marxist thought, communist society or the "dictatorship of the proletariat" is envisioned as a stage where the working class holds political power and controls the means of production, leading to a classless and stateless society. While some view this as a utopian ideal promoting equality and social justice, others criticize it as impractical and prone to authoritarianism.
A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production, where resources and wealth are shared among all members of the community.
As a result, a communist society is characterized by the collective ownership of resources and the absence of social classes.
In a communist society, economic necessity and collective ownership of resources would shape the distribution of goods and services, potentially leading to a more equitable society where everyone's basic needs are met.
Communist society is characterized by democratic processes, but also by a centralized government that controls the means of production and distribution of goods and services. This centralized control can lead to efficient resource allocation but may also stifle individual initiative and innovation. In theory, democratic processes aim to give power to the people, but in practice, the concentration of power in the hands of a few can undermine true democracy. It is a system that strives for equality and social welfare but often faces challenges in balancing individual freedoms with collective interests.
Pre-Marxist communism was also present in the form of early Christian communities, where members shared their possessions and lived a communal lifestyle based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. This form of communism emphasized equality, solidarity, and caring for the less fortunate, reflecting a sense of community and common good.
Primitive communism is a way of describing Primitive communism is a way of describing the socio-economic structure of early human societies, characterized by communal ownership of resources, lack of social hierarchy, and shared decision-making. It highlights a time when cooperation and mutual aid were essential for survival, promoting a sense of equality and collective well-being among members of the community. While some view primitive communism as an idyllic period devoid of exploitation and oppression, others argue that it was marked by limitations in terms of technological development and individual freedoms. Overall, the concept of primitive communism serves as a reminder of our shared history and the potential for alternative modes of organizing society based on cooperation and solidarity.
Religious communism is a form of communism that incorporates religious beliefs and values into its principles, blending economic equality with spiritual ideals. This fusion can offer a sense of community, morality, and purpose to its followers, inspiring them to work towards a society based on compassion and solidarity. However, the combination of religion and politics can also lead to conflicts over interpretation, dogma, and hierarchy, potentially diluting the original communist goals of classless society and stateless governance.
Additionally, Hillerbrand has contrasted "religious communism" with "secular socialism," highlighting the intersection of faith and politics in shaping ideologies and movements throughout history.
Larry Arnhart described "religious communism in the Larry Arnhart described "religious communism in the 19th century" as a complex intertwining of spiritual beliefs and socio-political ideals that sought to create a more egalitarian society based on communal ownership and cooperation. This concept emerged as a response to the perceived injustices and inequalities of industrial capitalism, with proponents drawing inspiration from both religious teachings advocating for social justice and socialist principles promoting economic equality. While some view religious communism as a noble attempt to reconcile faith with social activism, others criticize it for its potential to blur the lines between church and state, leading to concerns about the concentration of power and the erosion of individual freedoms. Ultimately, the legacy of religious communism in the 19th century serves as a reminder of the diverse ways in which people have sought to address societal challenges through a fusion of religious and political ideologies.
Christian communism is a form of religious Christian communism is a form of religious ideology that seeks to align the principles of Christianity with the communal ownership of resources and the elimination of social class distinctions. It emphasizes the teachings of Jesus Christ on love, equality, and caring for the marginalized in society.

Ultimately, Christian communism represents a complex intersection of faith, social justice, and economic theory that sparks debates on the role of religion in shaping socio-economic systems.
As such, many advocates of Christian communism believe in the principles of sharing resources and caring for the less fortunate as a way to embody Jesus's teachings of love, compassion, and equality.
Both Christian communism and liberation theology stress the importance of social justice and equality, albeit through different lenses. Christian communism emphasizes the communal ownership of resources and the redistribution of wealth based on Christian principles, seeking to eliminate class distinctions and promote solidarity among believers. Liberation theology, on the other hand, focuses on the liberation of oppressed communities, particularly the poor and marginalized, viewing Jesus Christ as a liberator who stands in solidarity with the oppressed. Both ideologies underscore the need for a more just and equitable society, albeit through different theological and practical approaches.
The history of communism encompasses a wide variety of ideologies and movements that have shaped societies around the world. From the idealistic visions of equality and shared wealth to the harsh realities of authoritarian rule and suppression of individual freedoms, communism has been a complex and controversial force in modern history.

Left communism, or the communist left, is a tendency within the broader socialist movement that emphasizes a more decentralized, anti-authoritarian approach to achieving communism. It is often critical of traditional Marxist-Leninist parties and states, advocating for worker self-management and direct democracy. While some view left communism as a refreshing alternative to top-down socialism, others criticize it for being too idealistic and lacking a clear strategy for achieving revolutionary change.
Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, a prominent Italian Marxist theorist and leader of the Communist Party of Italy. Known for his staunch opposition to reformism and parliamentary politics, Bordiga advocated for a revolutionary approach to socialism centered around the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat. His contributions to left communism emphasize the need for a vanguard party to lead the working class in the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society.
The historical origins of left communism come from the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the split within the international communist movement. Left communism emerged as a critique of the direction taken by the Bolsheviks under Lenin and later Stalin, emphasizing the need for a more decentralized and grassroots approach to socialism. Adherents of left communism view the Soviet model as authoritarian and centralized, advocating for worker self-management and a more directly democratic socialist society. While some see left communism as an important critique of traditional Marxist-Leninist parties, others argue that its emphasis on purity and doctrinal adherence can hinder practical political action.
Left communism first came into focus as a radical political theory that critiqued the perceived shortcomings of mainstream Marxist movements. It emphasized the importance of workers' councils and direct democracy, rejecting the idea of a vanguard party.
A communist state, also known as Marxist–Leninist A communist state, also known as Marxist-Leninist, is a form of government where the means of production are owned and controlled by the state, with the goal of achieving a classless society. While proponents argue that it can lead to a more equal distribution of resources and opportunities, critics often point to historical examples where communist states have resulted in authoritarian regimes, lack of individual freedoms, and economic inefficiency. It is a complex system that has sparked intense debate regarding its feasibility, implementation, and impact on society.
Terms used by communist states include national-democratic, and proletarian internationalism, which reflect their emphasis on national liberation movements and solidarity among the working class worldwide. These terms highlight the dual focus of communist states on achieving independence from imperialist powers while also promoting unity and cooperation among workers across borders. Critics may argue that such terms can be used to justify authoritarianism and suppress dissent, while supporters see them as essential for advancing socialism and challenging capitalist exploitation on a global scale.
Most communist states in Eastern Europe were characterized by centralized government control, planned economies, and restrictions on personal freedoms. While some proponents argue that these systems aimed to create a more equal society by redistributing wealth and resources, critics often point to the lack of political freedoms, human rights abuses, and economic inefficiencies that plagued many communist states in Eastern Europe. The collapse of these regimes in the late 20th century highlighted the challenges and shortcomings of implementing and sustaining communist ideologies in practice.
Communist states were also established in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Cuba, among other countries, with varying degrees of success and controversy.
A communist state was established in North Korea after World War II, leading to the division of the Korean Peninsula into North and South Korea.
In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe began to collapse, marking the end of an era and paving the way for significant geopolitical shifts. The fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the dismantling of oppressive regimes and the triumph of democracy and freedom. It was a time of hope, liberation, and the possibility of a new beginning for the people who had long lived under authoritarian rule. However, the transition to democracy was not without challenges, as economic hardships, social unrest, and political instability emerged in the aftermath of the collapse. The events of 1989 in Eastern Europe serve as a reminder of the power of grassroots movements, the resilience of human spirit, and the complexities of political transformation.
Today, the existing communist states in the world continue to face challenges in balancing centralized control with individual freedoms, highlighting the ongoing debate between state authority and personal liberties.
These communist states often do not claim to adhere to traditional capitalist economic structures, instead opting for centralized planning and state ownership of the means of production. While this approach aims to promote equality and eliminate class distinctions, it has also been criticized for stifling individual initiative and innovation, leading to inefficiencies and lack of consumer choice.
The constitutions of most communist states describe the establishment of a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively by the people, aiming to create a system that promotes equality and eliminates exploitation.
A feature of communist states is the centralized control of the means of production and distribution of goods and services by the government.
In communist states, the social organizations are often tightly controlled by the government in order to maintain power and suppress dissenting voices. This centralized control can limit individual freedoms and hinder the development of independent civil society movements. However, some argue that this level of oversight is necessary to ensure social cohesion and promote equality among citizens. Ultimately, the relationship between social organizations and the state in communist states is complex and varies depending on the specific political context.
In communist states, the government may not always prioritize individual freedoms and may exert significant control over various aspects of citizens' lives.
However, the goal of the communist state is to create a classless society where resources are shared equally among all individuals, aiming for a utopian vision of social and economic equality.
The communist state is the dictatorship of the proletariat, where the working class holds power and controls the means of production. This concept, proposed by Karl Marx, aims to establish a classless society where resources are shared equally among all members. However, history has shown that in practice, communist states often become authoritarian regimes where individual freedoms are suppressed and power is centralized in the hands of a few leaders. It is important to acknowledge both the idealistic goals of communism and the challenges and abuses that have arisen in its implementation.
The communist states have opted for two main approaches to economic planning: centralized planning and decentralized planning.
A number of the short-lived communist states struggled to implement their ideals in practice due to internal power struggles, external pressures, and economic challenges.
In addition, all communist states the ruling party holds significant control over the government and economy, leading to concerns about individual freedoms and lack of political pluralism.
This might explain why communist states have a history of centralized control and suppression of dissent, as the ideology places emphasis on collective ownership of resources and the means of production, which often leads to a concentration of power in the hands of a select few.
Communist states are committed to establish a Communist states are committed to establishing a system where the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole, aiming to create a classless society where resources are distributed equally among all members. While this ideology promises to promote social equality and eliminate exploitation, critics argue that it often leads to centralized power, lack of individual freedoms, and economic inefficiency. The debate over the effectiveness and sustainability of communist states continues to be a contentious issue in political discussions worldwide.
In communist states, there is usually a centralized government control over the means of production and distribution of goods and services.
A constitution in a communist state has a significant role in outlining the fundamental principles and structure of the government, serving as a guiding document for the administration of the state. It typically reflects the ideals of communism, emphasizing collective ownership, equality, and the central role of the state in economic and social affairs. However, the implementation of a constitution in a communist state may also raise questions about the balance between individual rights and state control, as well as the extent of political freedom and democracy within the system.
None of the surviving communist states have fully achieved the utopian vision of a classless society free from oppression and inequality.
Communist states have also been criticized for their lack of political and economic freedoms, leading to authoritarian regimes that stifle individual rights and creativity.
Barracks communism is the term coined by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci to describe the revolutionary potential of the military barracks as a site of class struggle and potential source of socialist transformation.
Scientific communism was one of the three major strains of Marxism that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alongside anarchist communism and social democracy. It sought to apply the scientific method to the analysis of society and economics, aiming to establish a classless society based on common ownership of the means of production. Advocates of scientific communism believed in the inevitability of socialism and ultimately communism, viewing historical development as driven by material conditions and class struggle. Critics, however, argue that the implementation of scientific communism often led to authoritarian regimes and human rights abuses, raising questions about the feasibility of achieving a truly classless society through centralized planning.

Scientific advancements have revolutionized the way we understand the world and have led to incredible breakthroughs in technology, medicine, and more.
National communism refers to the various forms of communist ideology that incorporate nationalist elements, emphasizing the importance of a strong national identity alongside socialist principles. This fusion of nationalism and communism can be seen as a way to appeal to a broader population by tapping into feelings of patriotism and cultural identity, while also promoting social equality and collective ownership. However, critics argue that national communism can lead to exclusionary practices, promoting a narrow definition of who belongs to the nation and potentially fostering xenophobia or conflicts with minority groups.
Whereas the influence of international communism was once a major geopolitical force during the 20th century, shaping the political landscape of many nations and sparking ideological conflicts, its impact has significantly waned in the modern era. The fall of the Soviet Union and the shift towards market economies in countries like China have led to a decline in the prevalence of international communism as a dominant ideology. However, its legacy still persists in various forms, influencing social movements, political discourse, and global power dynamics.
National communism also refers to non-Russian communist movements that prioritize national sovereignty and cultural identity within the framework of a communist ideology. It is often seen as a response to the historical dominance of Russian or Soviet communism and aims to adapt Marxist principles to the specific conditions and needs of a particular nation or ethnic group. While some view national communism as a way to promote indigenous culture and combat imperialism, others criticize it for potentially leading to isolationism and undermining international solidarity among workers.
War communism or military communism was the policy implemented by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. It was characterized by centralized state control over the economy, including nationalization of industry and strict requisitioning of food and supplies to support the Red Army. While it was seen as necessary to ensure survival during the war, it led to widespread shortages, famine, and civil unrest among the population. Ultimately, war communism laid the groundwork for the New Economic Policy (NEP) as a more pragmatic approach to economic management in the Soviet Union.
War communism began in June 1918, enforced by the Bolshevik government in Russia during the Russian Civil War. It was a policy characterized by centralized control over the economy, nationalization of industry, and requisitioning of agricultural goods. While it aimed to support the Red Army and maintain the revolution during a time of crisis, it led to widespread famine, economic chaos, and social unrest. The harsh measures of war communism showcased the challenges of balancing ideological goals with the practical needs of a society, highlighting the complexities of governance in times of conflict.
The Economic Organization of War Communism 1918—1921 The Economic Organization of War Communism from 1918 to 1921 was a policy implemented by the Bolshevik government in Soviet Russia during the Russian Civil War. It was characterized by centralized control over the economy, including nationalization of industry, strict rationing, and requisitioning of agricultural products. While it was intended to support the war effort and consolidate power, it led to widespread famine, economic chaos, and social unrest. The policy showcased the challenges of implementing extreme socialist measures in a time of crisis, highlighting the delicate balance between state control and individual freedoms in times of conflict.
Roberts, Paul C. "'War Communism': A Re-examination," argues that the policy of "War Communism" implemented by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War was a necessary response to the dire circumstances faced by the new Soviet government. It emphasizes the challenges of war, economic collapse, and counter-revolutionary forces that necessitated extreme measures to ensure survival. While acknowledging the brutality and shortcomings of "War Communism," Roberts sheds light on the complexities of the period, highlighting the trade-offs and difficult decisions faced by the Bolshevik leadership.

Council communism is a current of communist thought that emphasizes the importance of workers' councils as the primary form of organizing society and transitioning to communism. It stresses direct democracy and worker control over the means of production, aiming to eliminate the need for a centralized state. While some see council communism as a decentralized and more democratic alternative to traditional Marxism, others criticize it for its potential to lead to inefficiency and disorganization in large-scale societies.
Inspired by the November Revolution, council communism emphasizes worker councils as the foundation of a socialist society, advocating for direct democracy and grassroots decision-making. It seeks to challenge traditional hierarchical structures and promote worker control over the means of production. However, some critics argue that council communism may struggle to address issues of efficiency and coordination in large-scale economies, questioning its practicality on a broader scale.
According to van der Linden, council communism emphasizes workers' councils as the primary means of organizing society, advocating for direct democracy and worker control of the means of production.
