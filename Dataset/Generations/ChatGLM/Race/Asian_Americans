Army Chaplain James Yee on the Abuse Army Chaplain James Yee on the Abuse: An Inside Look at the Treatment of Detainees at Guantanamo Bay

In his book "For God and Country: Faith and Patriotism Under Fire," Army Chaplain (Captain) James Yee, a Muslim American, provides an insider's account of the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base after the September 11 attacks. Yee, who served as a chaplain at the detention camp from October 2002 to March 2003, witnessed firsthand the inhumane treatment of detainees and the breakdown of military values.

Yee's book, published in 2005, details the conditions in the detention camp and the abuse of prisoners, which later became a part of the wider debate over the treatment of enemy combatants and the role of military chaplains. Yee himself was detained and interrogated for several months in 2003-2004, after the military accused him of aiding the enemy, which led to charges of espionage, aiding the enemy, and conspiracy. All charges were eventually dropped, and Yee was released.

In his book, Yee describes the camp's physical layout, the process of receiving and processing new detainees, and the daily routines and restrictions that governed life at the camp. He also discusses the challenges of providing spiritual care to the detainees, who were held in outdoor cages called "dog boxes" and often subjected to harsh treatment and interrogation techniques that some lawyers and human rights activists have described as torture.

Yee's account provides a critical perspective on the military's handling of the detainee situation and highlights the difficult moral and ethical choices faced by military personnel in the aftermath of a significant national security event. His book serves as an important historical document and contributes to the ongoing conversation about the balance between national security and the preservation of American values.
