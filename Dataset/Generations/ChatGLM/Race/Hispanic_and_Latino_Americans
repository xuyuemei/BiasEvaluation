After his return, he continued to display his exceptional skills, hitting .342 in 1946 and winning his second Triple Crown in 1947. In 1952, he was once again called up for military service, serving in the Korean War. Throughout his career, Williams received numerous accolades, including two Triple Crowns, six batting titles, and two MVP awards. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966.
