战争共产主义政策的主要特点包括：

1. 实行粮食征购，即从农民那里以低于市场价的价格征购粮食和其他农产品。
2. 实行工业国有化，将私人企业和工厂转为国有。
3. 取消自由贸易，实行计划经济，即政府对生产、分配和交换进行严格控制。
4. 实行普遍劳动义务，即所有公民都必须为国家指定的工作做贡献。
5. 取消货币和市场，代之以商品交换和票证制度。

这一政策的实施在短期内确实为苏联提供了必要的物资和资源，以抵御内战和外部干涉，但同时也导致了农民的不满和抵制，以及生产效率的下降。在列宁的领导下，苏联在1921年放弃了战争共产主义政策，转而实行新经济政策（NEP），这是一种更为灵活和务实的政治经济政策，允许私有财产和市场交易的存在，以恢复经济秩序和提高生产效率。
