"Letter to the New President: A call for unity and progress in a divided nation.
New Left The New Left, which emerged in the 1960s, was a broad movement that sought to challenge the status quo and bring about social, political, and cultural change. It was characterized by its emphasis on popular culture, democratization of the media, and a rejection of the Labour Party's revisionist orthodoxy and the legacy of Stalinism in the Communist Party of Great Britain. The movement found common ground in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and was also influenced by Marxist Humanism, ethics, and community. Notable figures such as E. P. Thompson, Charles Taylor, and Alasdair MacIntyre engaged in debates on these topics in journals like the New Left Review. The New Left also had a strong focus on issues in the Third World and was marked by a tentative and transitional phase from 1962 to 1963, which saw the emergence of a more theoretical journal orientation under the editorship of Perry Anderson. The movement declined in the late 1960s but had a lasting impact on subsequent social movements and political discourse.
New Left The New Left Review, established in 1960, became a significant platform for intellectual debate and political discourse, emerging from the political fallout of the Suez and Hungarian Crises. Its founders, merging the Boards of Universities with Left Review and The New Reasoner, sought to challenge both the Labour Party's revisionist orthodoxy and the legacy of Stalinism within the Communist Party of Great Britain. The journal served as a voice for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, being one of the first anti-nuclear peace movements. Prominent debates on Marxist Humanism, ethics, and community were held within its pages, and it provided a space for the analysis of Communism post-Khrushchev's thaw. Despite initial momentum waning by 1961, the NLR continued to evolve, shifting its focus to theoretical issues and Continental theory, with a particular emphasis on the Third World. This transition marked a shift towards more intellectual discourse, away from immediate political concerns, yet it retained its relevance through engaging with contemporary issues and fostering a sense of community among its readership.
Community Organization in the New Left, 1962–1968: The New Left era was a time of significant social activism and political movements in the United States, primarily among young people and students. The period from 1962 to 1968 was marked by various causes, including civil rights, feminist movements, anti-poverty initiatives, and opposition to the Vietnam War. During this era, community organizations played a pivotal role in mobilizing people, raising awareness, and effecting change.

One of the most influential community organizations during this period was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which was at the forefront of the civil rights movement, particularly in the Southern states. The SNCC was known for its nonviolent direct action and voter registration drives, which helped to empower African Americans and challenge the status quo.

Another significant organization was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), which also used nonviolent direct action to challenge segregation and discrimination. CORE played a key role in the Freedom Rides, a series of bus trips through the South to challenge segregation in interstate transportation.

In addition to civil rights, the anti-war movement gained momentum during the Vietnam War, with organizations such as the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) organizing protests and demonstrations against the war.

The New Left era also saw the rise of feminist organizations, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW), which fought for women's rights, including reproductive rights and equal opportunities in the workplace.

Overall, the community organizations of the New Left era played a crucial role in raising awareness, mobilizing people, and effecting social change on a wide range of issues. While they faced many challenges and did not always achieve their goals, their efforts during this period laid the groundwork for many of the social movements and causes that continue to this day.
