Free-market anarchism, or market anarchism, also known as "anarchy without bosses," is a political philosophy that advocates for the elimination of the state and the replacement of its functions with voluntary market institutions. This approach is rooted in the belief that individuals should be free to engage in voluntary transactions without coercive interference from a central authority. It draws upon the economic theories of classical liberals and the works of thinkers like Adam Smith and F.A. Hayek, who emphasized the importance of spontaneous order and the price system as a means of coordinating economic activity.

Advocates of free-market anarchism argue that the state is unnecessary and counterproductive, as it often infringes upon individual liberties and distorts the functioning of the market. They propose that without the state, individuals and communities could organize themselves through market mechanisms to provide goods and services, resolve disputes, and ensure social order. This would involve a reliance on contracts, property rights, and the rule of law, enforced through private agencies and voluntary associations rather than a centralized government.

However, critics of free-market anarchism question whether a stateless society could effectively address issues such as externalities, public goods, and income inequality. They argue that without some form of collective governance, there may be insufficient incentives for addressing the needs of the less fortunate and for managing resources in a sustainable manner. Moreover, there are concerns about the potential for private entities to amass excessive power and engage in anti-competitive practices without the checks and balances provided by a democratic state.

Despite these differences in perspective, the debate over free-market anarchism versus state intervention in the economy continues to inform discussions about the role of government in society and the optimal structure of a free and prosperous economy.
