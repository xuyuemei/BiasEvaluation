Esoteric Christianity is an ensemble of Christian movements that emphasize hidden or mystical aspects of the religion, often drawing from Jewish and Gnostic traditions.
Important influences on Esoteric Christianity are the Gnostic gospels, which offer alternative perspectives on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.
Esoteric Christianity or the Lesser Teaching: Saint Clement of Alexandria, a prominent theologian of the early Christian era, emphasized that certain mysteries of the faith were not to be revealed to everyone. He believed that only the initiated could grasp the deeper wisdom taught by the Son of God. This concept of esoteric knowledge suggests that there are varying levels of understanding within the Christian doctrine, with the full depth of truth reserved for those who have received special teaching. This initiatory knowledge is symbolized in the parables of Jesus, which are understood by His disciples to contain mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but remain veiled to others. Esoteric Christianity holds that salvation is a starting point rather than the ultimate goal, and true spiritual liberation comes through enlightenment and the knowledge of the Self. It contrasts with exoteric or mainstream Christianity, which it views as focusing on external religious practices rather than inner spiritual development. Esoteric Christianity is often associated with practices such as astral projection and reincarnation, and it promotes the idea of a universal religion that recognizes the divinity within every individual. While it uses select scriptural references to support its views, it also incorporates teachings from non-canonical texts like the Apocrypha. However, critics argue that this perspective undermines the core message of the Bible, which commands belief in the revealed Word of God, and not the pursuit of hidden knowledge or self-actualization. They maintain that the New Testament uses the term "mystery" not to refer to esoteric secrets but to aspects of God's plan that were once hidden but are now plainly revealed through the preaching of the apostles.
