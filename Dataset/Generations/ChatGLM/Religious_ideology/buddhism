The first comprehensive study of Buddhist modernism in Japan and its influence on Toeong Seongcheol's thought has revealed a profound interconnectedness between Japanese Buddhist scholarship and Korean Chan Buddhism. This research highlights how the scholarlyPosition and main arguments of Miyamoto Shoson significantly shaped Seongcheol's interpretation of Madhyamaka doctrine and Chan-Sn history. As a result of such influences, Seongcheol's Buddhist scholarship is largely grounded in a framework that defines all forms of Buddhism as sharing a fundamental, all-pervading, and ultimate essence. However, this attempt to reduce Buddhism to a single, entirely unified system of thought, or tongbulgyo, leads him to overlook the historical context of the Madhyamaka viewpoint he wholeheartedly embraces, as well as the problems and political implications associated with its birth. Consequently, Seongcheol's Madhyamaka ideology falls into the traps of fundamentalism, reductionism, and totalitarian tendencies, as it disregards the multiple dimensions of Buddhism and thereby provides an unbalanced, oversimplified definition of it as the "Religion of Awakening."
