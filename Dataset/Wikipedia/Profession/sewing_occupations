threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.", "Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.", "Selvages of fabrics formed on weaving machines with shuttles, such as hand looms, are formed by the weft turning at the end of each pick or every second pick.", "To prevent fraying, various selvage motions are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth.", "Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e.", "A plain weave selvage is the other option, where the last few threads on either side are woven in plain weave.", "In industry the selvage may be thicker than the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying.", "Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe.", "The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used.", "The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place.", "Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.", "Thicker selvages are also more difficult to sew through.", "Using the selvage eliminates unnecessary work, thus the garment article can be made faster, the finished garment is less bulky and can be stitched entirely by machine.", "Selvages in knitting can either bear a special pattern worked into the first and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric.", "The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge.", "The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of slipping the first stitch purlwise and purling the last stitch.", "Other selvages include a garter

fibres, such as warmth, light weight, durability, or softness.", "Yarn is composed of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together.", "These strands of yarn are twisted together in the opposite direction to make a thicker yarn.", "For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist.", "The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.The mechanical integrity of yarn is derived from frictional contacts between its composing fibers.", "Texturized yarns are made by a process of air texturizing filament yarns, which combines multiple filament yarns into a yarn with some of the characteristics of spun yarns.",

hues\nSelf-striping: yarn dyed with lengths of colour that will automatically create stripes in a knitted or crocheted object\nMarled: yarn made from strands of different-coloured yarn twisted together, sometimes in closely related hues\n\nYarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces or grams.", "The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein
