International.", "Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.Several studies have found evidence that trade unions can reduce competitiveness due to a reduction of business profit, which can then lead to job losses as it makes the business unable to
